next_steps:
  - "Review and commit epic planning artifacts"
  - "Decide: Start implementation OR create detailed story files"
  - "If starting implementation: Create feature branch and begin Epic 1"
  - "If creating stories: Break down epics into individual story files"

decisions_needed:
  - question: "Start implementation now or create individual story files first?"
    context: "Stories are well-defined in epic files; separate files optional"
    options:
      - "Start Epic 1 implementation directly from epic file"
      - "Create individual story .md files for tracking"

  - question: "Implementation order for epics?"
    recommendation: "Epic 1 → Epic 2 → Epic 6 → Epic 3 → Epic 4 → Epic 5"
    rationale: "Epic 1 is foundational; Epic 2 depends on it; Epics 6+3 share backup logic"
