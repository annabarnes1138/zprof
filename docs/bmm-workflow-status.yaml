next_steps:
  - "Review and commit epic planning and story artifacts"
  - "Decide on next phase: Architecture Review, Technical Design, or start implementation"
  - "If starting implementation: Create feature branch and begin Epic 1"
  - "If doing architecture: Review technical designs in epic files and create architecture doc"

decisions_needed:
  - question: "Need architecture review before implementation?"
    context: "Technical designs are included in epic files"
    options:
      - "Create comprehensive architecture document from epic technical designs"
      - "Start implementation using epic technical designs as-is"

  - question: "Implementation order for epics?"
    recommendation: "Epic 1 → Epic 2 → Epic 6 → Epic 3 → Epic 4 → Epic 5"
    rationale: "Epic 1 is foundational; Epic 2 depends on it; Epics 6+3 share backup logic"
